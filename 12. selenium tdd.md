In Test-Driven Development (TDD), you follow a cycle of "Red-Green-Refactor," where you write a failing test first (Red), make the test pass by writing the minimum amount of code (Green), and then refactor the code while keeping the tests passing. To separate the setup and tear down phases, you can use testing frameworks like JUnit, which provides annotations for setting up and tearing down test environments.

Here's how you can set up your Selenium test using TDD with JUnit:

**1. Set Up a JUnit Test Class:**

Create a new Java class for your Selenium test, and annotate it with JUnit's `@Test` annotation. In your test class, you can use methods annotated with `@Before` for setup and `@After` for teardown.

```java
import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class SeleniumTest {
    private WebDriver driver;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Set the path to the Chrome WebDriver
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");
        // Initialize the WebDriver
        driver = new ChromeDriver();
    }

    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }

    @Test
    public void testSeleniumInteraction() {
        // Your test code goes here
    }
}
```

In this example, the `setUp` method is executed before each test method annotated with `@Test`, and the `tearDown` method is executed after each test method. This allows you to set up and tear down the test environment for each test method.

**2. Write Your Selenium Test:**

Inside the `@Test` method, you can write your Selenium test code. For instance, you can interact with web elements, perform actions, and make assertions.

```java
@Test
public void testSeleniumInteraction() {
    driver.get("https://example.com");

    // Your test code here
    WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type='text']"));
    element.sendKeys("Selenium Test");
    element.submit();

    // Add assertions
    // Assert.assertTrue(driver.getPageSource().contains("Expected text"));
}
```

**3. Run the Test:**

With your setup, test, and teardown methods in place, you can run the JUnit test. It will automatically execute the `setUp` method before your test method and the `tearDown` method afterward.

This separation of setup and teardown ensures that your test environment is properly initialized before each test method and cleaned up afterward, making your tests more maintainable and easier to reason about.

Remember to replace `"path/to/chromedriver"` with the actual path to the WebDriver executable on your system. Additionally, you can add assertions to your test methods to validate that the expected behavior is met. TDD encourages you to write failing tests first, so initially, your assertions might fail, but you will implement the actual code to make them pass in the "Green" phase.
