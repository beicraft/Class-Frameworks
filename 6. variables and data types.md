In Java, variables and data types are fundamental concepts that allow you to store and manipulate different types of data. Let's explore the commonly used data types and how to use them:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**

   Java provides several primitive data types, which are simple types that hold basic values. They include:

   - `int`: Represents integers, e.g., `int age = 25;`.
   - `double`: Represents floating-point numbers (decimals), e.g., `double price = 19.99;`.
   - `boolean`: Represents true or false values, e.g., `boolean isJavaFun = true;`.
   - `char`: Represents a single character, e.g., `char grade = 'A';`.
   - `byte`, `short`, and `long`: Represent various integer data types with different ranges, e.g., `byte b = 10;`.

   Example of using primitive data types:

   ```java
   int age = 25;
   double price = 19.99;
   boolean isJavaFun = true;
   char grade = 'A';
   ```

2. **Reference Data Types:**

   Reference data types, also known as object types, store references to objects rather than the data itself. Common reference data types include:

   - `String`: Represents a sequence of characters, e.g., `String name = "John";`.
   - `Arrays`: Arrays are objects that can hold multiple values of the same type, e.g., `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};`.

   Example of using reference data types:

   ```java
   String name = "John";
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
   ```

3. **Custom Data Types (Classes):**

   You can define your own custom data types by creating classes. These classes can have instance variables (fields) and methods, allowing you to model complex data structures.

   Example of using a custom data type:

   ```java
   public class Person {
       String name;
       int age;

       public void introduce() {
           System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Person person = new Person();
       person.name = "Alice";
       person.age = 30;
       person.introduce();
   }
   ```

4. **Using Variables:**

   Variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated in your program. You can declare variables, assign values to them, and perform operations using these variables.

   ```java
   int x = 10; // Declare and initialize a variable
   int y = 5;
   int sum = x + y; // Perform an operation using variables
   ```

5. **Type Casting:**

   Java provides mechanisms for converting between different data types. You can explicitly cast one data type to another using type casting.

   ```java
   double price = 19.99;
   int priceInt = (int) price; // Explicitly cast a double to an int
   ```

6. **Constants:**

   Constants are variables whose values should not change during the program's execution. You can declare constants using the `final` keyword.

   ```java
   final double PI = 3.14159265359;
   ```

Variables and data types in Java are crucial for writing programs that handle different types of data. They allow you to store, manipulate, and represent information in various ways to perform complex tasks and solve problems. Understanding and effectively using these concepts is essential in Java programming.
