The anatomy of a Java program consists of various components and structures that make up a Java source code file. Here is a basic outline of what a typical Java program looks like:

```java
// Import statements
import java.util.*; // Importing the java.util package

// Class definition
public class MyJavaProgram {

    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Program execution starts here

        // Variable declaration and initialization
        int number = 42;

        // Conditional statements
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is non-positive.");
        }

        // Looping statements
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration " + (i + 1));
        }

        // Function (method) definition
        public static void someFunction() {
            // Code for the function
        }

        // Function (method) call
        someFunction();

        // Object instantiation
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input and output
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");

        // Resource cleanup (closing the scanner)
        scanner.close();

        // Program execution ends here
    }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the key components of a Java program:

1. **Import Statements:** These are used to bring in external classes and packages that your program needs. In the example, `import java.util.*` is used to import classes from the `java.util` package.

2. **Class Definition:** Java programs are organized into classes. The `public class MyJavaProgram` is an example of a class definition. The name of the class (in this case, `MyJavaProgram`) should match the filename.

3. **Main Method:** Every Java program must have a `public static void main(String[] args)` method. This is the entry point of the program, and it's where the execution begins.

4. **Variable Declaration:** You can declare and initialize variables within the `main` method. In the example, `int number = 42;` declares an integer variable.

5. **Conditional Statements:** You can use `if` and `else` statements to add conditional logic to your program.

6. **Looping Statements:** Java supports loops like `for`, `while`, and `do-while` for iteration and repetition.

7. **Function (Method) Definition:** You can define your own methods (functions) within the class to organize and reuse code.

8. **Function (Method) Call:** Methods are called to execute a specific block of code. In the example, `someFunction();` calls a method named `someFunction`.

9. **Object Instantiation:** You can create instances of classes using the `new` keyword. In the example, `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates a `Scanner` object.

10. **Input and Output:** Java provides classes like `System.in` and `System.out` for input and output operations. In the example, `System.out.println` is used for output, and `scanner.nextLine()` is used to read input.

11. **Resource Cleanup:** It's important to close resources like `Scanner` objects when you're done with them to avoid resource leaks.

This is a simplified example, and real-world Java programs can be much more complex, but this should give you a good starting point for understanding the structure of a Java program.
