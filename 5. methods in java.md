In Java, methods are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and are typically defined within classes. There are various types of methods in Java, each with a specific purpose. Here are some common types of methods and examples of how they are called:

1. **Instance Methods:**

   - These methods are associated with instances (objects) of a class.
   - They can access and modify instance variables of the class.
   - You call instance methods using an object of the class.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Person {
       String name;

       public void sayHello() {
           System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Person person1 = new Person();
       person1.name = "Alice";
       person1.sayHello(); // Calling an instance method

       Person person2 = new Person();
       person2.name = "Bob";
       person2.sayHello(); // Calling the same method on a different object
   }
   ```

2. **Static Methods:**

   - Static methods belong to the class itself, not to instances.
   - They cannot access instance variables and are called using the class name.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class MathHelper {
       public static int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int result = MathHelper.add(5, 3); // Calling a static method
   }
   ```

3. **Constructor Methods:**

   - Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.
   - They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.
   - Constructors are automatically called when an object is created.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Person {
       String name;

       public Person(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Person person = new Person("Alice"); // Constructor is called when creating an object
   }
   ```

4. **Getter and Setter Methods:**

   - Getter methods are used to retrieve the values of private instance variables.
   - Setter methods are used to modify the values of private instance variables.
   - They help control access to class fields.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class Person {
       private String name;

       public String getName() {
           return name; // Getter method
       }

       public void setName(String name) {
           this.name = name; // Setter method
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Person person = new Person();
       person.setName("Alice"); // Setter method sets the name
       String name = person.getName(); // Getter method retrieves the name
   }
   ```

5. **Overloaded Methods:**

   - Overloaded methods have the same name but different parameter lists (number or types of parameters).
   - They allow you to create methods with the same name that perform different tasks.

   Example:

   ```java
   public class MathHelper {
       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       public double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       MathHelper math = new MathHelper();
       int result1 = math.add(5, 3); // Calls the int version
       double result2 = math.add(2.5, 3.7); // Calls the double version
   }
   ```

These are some of the common types of methods in Java and how they are called. The choice of method type depends on the specific task and the design of your classes and objects.
