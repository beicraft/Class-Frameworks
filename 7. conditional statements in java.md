Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of a program based on specified conditions. They allow you to make decisions and execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false. Here are the primary conditional statements in Java and how they're used:

1. **if Statement:**

   - The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a given condition is true.
   - It can be followed by an optional `else` block to specify code to execute when the condition is false.

   Example:

   ```java
   int age = 25;
   if (age >= 18) {
       System.out.println("You are an adult.");
   } else {
       System.out.println("You are a minor.");
   }
   ```

2. **if-else if-else Statement:**

   - The `if-else if-else` statement allows you to test multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the first true condition.

   Example:

   ```java
   int score = 85;
   if (score >= 90) {
       System.out.println("A");
   } else if (score >= 80) {
       System.out.println("B");
   } else if (score >= 70) {
       System.out.println("C");
   } else {
       System.out.println("F");
   }
   ```

3. **Switch Statement:**

   - The `switch` statement is used when you have a variable and want to execute different code blocks based on its value.
   - It works with numeric, character, or enumeration data types.
   - You can have multiple `case` labels and an optional `default` block to handle unmatched values.

   Example:

   ```java
   int day = 3;
   switch (day) {
       case 1:
           System.out.println("Monday");
           break;
       case 2:
           System.out.println("Tuesday");
           break;
       // ...
       default:
           System.out.println("Invalid day");
   }
   ```

4. **Ternary Operator:**

   - The ternary operator (`? :`) provides a concise way to express conditional statements within an expression.
   - It returns one of two values based on a condition.

   Example:

   ```java
   int age = 20;
   String status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
   ```

5. **Nested Conditional Statements:**

   - Conditional statements can be nested inside each other to create more complex logic.
   - It allows for fine-grained control over program flow.

   Example:

   ```java
   int x = 5;
   int y = 10;
   if (x > 0) {
       if (y > 0) {
           System.out.println("Both x and y are positive.");
       } else {
           System.out.println("x is positive, but y is not.");
       }
   } else {
       System.out.println("x is not positive.");
   }
   ```

Conditional statements are essential for making decisions in your Java programs, whether it's controlling the flow of your program, validating user input, or handling various scenarios based on conditions. By using these constructs, you can write more flexible and responsive code to achieve the desired behavior in your applications.
